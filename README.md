# Module 5 fuzzy-robot

## Description
This site is a work day scheduler. The user can add tasks by the hour to the scheduler and save it into local storage. The scheduler also retrieves the local storage data on first load so all the previously saved tasks remain on the screen.

## Installation
Create a folder and name it whatever you'd like. Open said folder with gitbash(Windows) or terminal(Mac). Simply type in: git clone This will clone the codebase from my remote repository to your local machine. Open the expert-engine folder that has been cloned onto your machine in any IDE to see and edit the codebase.

Git clone https: https://github.com/WilliamL1998/fuzzy-robot.git URL of deployed application: https://williaml1998.github.io/fuzzy-robot/

## Usage
On load, the scheduler tells you today's day of the week and the date. The scheduler runs from 9:00 to 17:00, the standard work hour. The time blocks are colourcoded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When you click into a time block, you may edit its contents. When the save button is clicked, the corresponding time block contents are saved to local storage and an alert is shown. It is dismissable by the user and by itself after 5 seconds.
